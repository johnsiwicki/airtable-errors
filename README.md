# Airtable Errors

I wanted to have something that would quickly log all my errors in an application. 

## Setup 

- Make a new base in Airtable with Error message, URL and Line as fields 
- https://airtable.com/api Pick your base to get your url and api key 
- I used axios for posting data https://github.com/axios/axios
